     * This example demonstrates two things.
     * 1) The "content" variable is declared after it was used.
     *    This is possible because JavaScript hoists declarations to the top of a scope.
     * 2) Declaring and calling functions in one step.
     *    The cool thing is: This function is only accessible once.
     *    In other words, after this function was called, it cannot be called
     *    from anywhere else in the script.
     *    Of course, this does not make much sense in this example,
     *    it's only meant to demonstrate that this is possible in JavaScript.
