# Tutorial 05 - AJAX with Vanilla JS and jQuery #

The content in this tutorial and assignment are quite a lot. Please deal with it properly, prepare yourself!


## PHP ##

Although we have left the PHP chapter behind us for now, in order to perform AJAX requests, it is still very useful.
So, we provide a couple of PHP scripts that serve as an initial resource for your AJAX tasks. 

## JavaScript ##
We are really starting to dive into the nitty gritty of JavaScript. We hope you enjoy it as much as we do.

## jQuery ##
... is likely to be part of the exam. We know that many people are in favor of other frameworks (or none at all), 
but since jQuery has such a high market penetration, we consider it worthwhile to look at it. You can still dislike it 
afterwards, that's ok. But your employer might not want to rewrite all their web apps just because you are convinced
that jQuery is the devil. So be prepared to work with it.
